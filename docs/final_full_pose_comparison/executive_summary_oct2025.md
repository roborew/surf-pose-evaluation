# Pose Estimation Library Comparison - Executive Summary

## October 2025 Evaluation with Consensus-Based Optimization

**Experiment:** final_full_pose_comparison | **Date:** Oct 25-26, 2025 | **Duration:** 20.98 hours

---

## Bottom Line

**For All Surf Pose Applications:** **YOLOv8-Pose (Large, Consensus-Tuned)**

**Why:** Near-perfect detection (98.5% F1), best consensus accuracy (85.5%), fast processing (99 FPS), moderate size (50.5 MB). **Consensus-based optimization achieved 6.6% accuracy improvement** over traditional tuning.

**Critical Finding:** Consensus-based PCK optimization successfully improved YOLOv8 but caused PyTorch Pose to become over-conservative (41% detection rate).

**Not Viable:** MediaPipe and BlazePose detected <5% of poses - unsuitable.

## Consensus-Based Optimization Results

This evaluation's key innovation: **Using consensus PCK as the optimization objective** instead of traditional detection metrics.

### YOLOv8-Pose: Major Success ‚úÖ

| Metric             | Traditional Tuning | Consensus Tuning  | Improvement |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Consensus PCK@0.2  | 78.9%              | **85.5%**         | **+6.6%**   |
| Model Size         | 11.6 MB ('s')      | **50.5 MB ('l')** | Larger      |
| Detection F1       | 99.3%              | 98.5%             | -0.8%       |
| FPS                | 142                | 99                | -43 FPS     |
| **Recommendation** | Good               | **Better**        | ‚úì           |

**Analysis:** Consensus optimization successfully selected larger, more accurate model while maintaining excellent speed. Trade-off well-balanced.

### PyTorch Pose: Over-Conservative ‚ùå

| Metric               | Traditional Tuning | Consensus Tuning | Change      |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Detection Rate       | ~84%               | **41.1%**        | **-43%** ‚ùå |
| Consensus PCK@0.2    | 78.8%              | **51.4%**        | **-27%** ‚ùå |
| Confidence Threshold | ~0.5               | **0.988**        | Too high    |
| Max Detections       | ~100               | **10**           | Too low     |
| **Recommendation**   | Good               | **Do not use**   | ‚ùå          |

**Analysis:** Consensus optimization set parameters too conservatively, causing detection collapse. Needs broader parameter search ranges.

### MMPose: No Optimization (Regression Observed)

| Metric            | Oct 19 Run | Oct 25 Run | Change      |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Consensus PCK@0.2 | 92.9%      | **67.9%**  | **-25%** ‚ùå |
| COCO PCK@0.2      | 89.8%      | **89.8%**  | Same ‚úì      |
| Detection F1      | 93.3%      | 93.3%      | Same ‚úì      |

**Analysis:** MMPose used pre-determined parameters (no trials). Regression in surf consensus may be due to dataset differences or ensemble interaction with consensus-tuned YOLOv8.

## Key Lessons Learned

### Consensus-Based Optimization

**What Worked:**

- ‚úÖ YOLOv8-Pose: 6.6% accuracy improvement, selected optimal model size
- ‚úÖ Robust objective function (not just detection rate)
- ‚úÖ Better alignment with real accuracy goals

**What Didn't Work:**

- ‚ùå PyTorch Pose: Over-conservative parameters (conf=0.988, max_det=10)
- ‚ùå Detection rate collapsed to 41.1%
- ‚ùå Need broader parameter search ranges

**Recommendations for Future:**

1. Use consensus PCK optimization for all models (including MMPose)
2. Set permissive parameter ranges (confidence 0.2-0.9, max_det 20-300)
3. Include detection rate as constraint (>80%)
4. Test on held-out validation set during optimization
