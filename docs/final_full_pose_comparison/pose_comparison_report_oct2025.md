## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art pose estimation libraries tested on surf action footage and COCO validation imagery. **This evaluation used consensus-based PCK optimization** for YOLOv8-Pose and PyTorch Pose models, representing a significant methodological improvement over traditional detection-based metrics.

### Key Findings

**Best Overall Performer:** YOLOv8-Pose (Large)

- **Highest Consensus Accuracy:** 85.5% (PCK@0.2) - dramatically improved with consensus tuning
- **Perfect Detection:** 100% detection rate, 98.5% F1 score
- **Fast Processing:** 99.2 FPS on comparison data
- **Moderate Size:** 50.5 MB (larger than 's' variant but still compact)

**Runner-up:** MMPose

- **Good Consensus Accuracy:** 67.9% (PCK@0.2)
- **Strong COCO Performance:** 89.8% (PCK@0.2)
- **Complete Skeletons:** 100% skeleton completeness
- **Trade-off:** Slowest processing (32.7 FPS)

**Critical Finding:** MediaPipe and BlazePose demonstrated severe limitations on surf footage, detecting only 3.4% and 0.9% of poses respectively, making them unsuitable for this application despite fast processing speeds.

**Important Note:** PyTorch Pose showed significantly reduced performance in comparison phase (41.1% detection rate, 51.4% consensus) despite optimization, suggesting the consensus-tuned parameters may have been too conservative for the full dataset.

### 1.2 Evaluation Architecture

The evaluation employed a three-phase architecture designed to comprehensively assess each model's capabilities:

#### Phase 1: Hyperparameter Optimization (Optuna)

**Objective:** Identify optimal model configurations for surf pose analysis **using consensus-based metrics**

**Dataset:** 200 surf maneuvers (50 video clips) from SONY_300 camera  
**Duration:** 5.6 hours across all models  
**Optimization Framework:**

- **Sampler:** Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)
- **Pruner:** Median Pruner for early stopping
- **Objective Function:** **Consensus PCK@0.2** (for YOLOv8 and PyTorch) - This is the key innovation
- **Trials:** Pre-determined configurations tested (0 iterative trials for MediaPipe/BlazePose/MMPose)

**Per-Model Optimization Time:**

- MMPose: 1.76 hours
- PyTorch Pose: 1.75 hours (11 trials)
- BlazePose: 0.83 hours
- MediaPipe: 0.78 hours
- YOLOv8-Pose: 0.50 hours (10 trials)

**Consensus-Based Optimization:**

This evaluation used **consensus PCK** as the optimization objective for YOLOv8-Pose and PyTorch Pose, rather than traditional detection metrics. Consensus PCK measures agreement with an ensemble of other models' predictions, providing a more robust accuracy signal even without manual ground truth annotations.

- **YOLOv8:** Trial 10 achieved best score of 0.718 (consensus PCK@0.2 = 71.8%)
- **PyTorch:** Trial 11 achieved best score of 0.781 (consensus PCK@0.2 = 78.1%)

#### Phase 2: COCO Validation

**Objective:** Establish standardized benchmark performance

**Dataset:** 100 images from COCO 2017 validation set  
**Metrics:**

- **PCK (Percentage of Correct Keypoints):** Measured at thresholds of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 of torso diameter
- **Detection Metrics:** Precision, recall, F1 score for person detection
- **Processing Speed:** FPS and inference latency

**Significance:** COCO validation provides:

- Standardized comparison with published literature
- Assessment of generalization to diverse poses and environments
- Validation of keypoint localization accuracy independent of surf-specific characteristics

#### Phase 3: Comprehensive Surf Comparison

**Objective:** Evaluate real-world performance on target application

**Dataset:** 715 surf maneuvers (200 video clips) from SONY_300 and SONY_70 cameras  
**Duration:** Remaining evaluation time  
**Evaluation Metrics:**

- **Accuracy:** Consensus-based PCK, detection F1
- **Performance:** FPS, latency percentiles (P95, P99), memory usage
- **Stability:** Pose jitter, detection consistency, keypoint consistency
- **Completeness:** Skeleton completeness, valid keypoint ratio

**Consensus Validation Approach:**

Multi-model consensus used as proxy ground truth in absence of manual annotations:

- Compare each model's predictions against ensemble of all other models
- Calculate PCK agreement within 20% threshold
- Provides robustness measure and relative accuracy assessment

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### 3.1 Model-Specific Performance

#### YOLOv8-Pose (Large, Consensus-Tuned)

**Strengths:**

- **Best consensus accuracy:** 85.5% PCK@0.2 (7% improvement over non-consensus tuning)
- **Near-perfect detection:** 98.5% F1 score, 100% detection rate
- **Fast processing:** 99.2 FPS (real-time capable)
- **Excellent COCO performance:** 87.4% PCK@0.2, 70.5% PCK@0.1
- **Good efficiency:** 1.96 FPS/MB (best among accurate models)
- **Low latency:** 11.31ms P95, 12.73ms P99
- **Excellent consistency:** 96.9% detection consistency
- **Lowest jitter:** 5.53 pixels

**Weaknesses:**

- Incomplete skeletons: 42.5% completeness
- Higher pose instability: 0.585 due to partial detections
- Larger model size: 50.5 MB (vs 11.6 MB for 's' variant)
- Higher memory usage: 206 MB (vs ~32 MB for lightweight models)

**Best For:** **Primary recommendation for all surf pose applications.** The consensus-based optimization significantly improved accuracy while maintaining excellent speed.

#### MMPose

**Strengths:**

- **Best COCO accuracy:** 89.8% PCK@0.2, 75.5% PCK@0.1
- Complete skeletons: 100% completeness
- Excellent keypoint localization precision
- Perfect detection rate: 100%
- Good pose stability: 0.112

**Weaknesses:**

- **Unexpected consensus regression:** 67.9% (vs 92.9% in previous run)
- Slowest processing: 32.7 FPS (3× slower than YOLOv8)
- Highest memory: 181.6 MB runtime
- Highest CPU utilization: 17.7%
- High jitter: 56.54 pixels
- Lowest efficiency score: 0.18 FPS/MB

**Analysis:** The regression in consensus accuracy (from 92.9% to 67.9%) is unexpected and warrants investigation. Possible causes include dataset differences or interaction with consensus-tuned YOLOv8 affecting ensemble predictions.

**Best For:** COCO benchmark validation, complete skeleton requirements, offline analysis where speed is not critical.

#### PyTorch Pose (Consensus-Tuned)

**Strengths:**

- Complete skeletons: 100% completeness
- **Best stability:** 0.090 (most consistent tracking)
- Low jitter: 11.29 pixels
- Excellent COCO accuracy: 86.5% PCK@0.2
- Best COCO detection F1: 79.3% (balanced precision/recall)

**Weaknesses:**

- **Severe detection failure:** 41.1% detection rate (58.9% of poses missed!)
- **Poor consensus accuracy:** 51.4% PCK@0.2
- Very conservative: confidence_threshold=0.988 likely too high
- Slow processing: 39.9 FPS
- High memory: 271.9 MB
- Only 10 max_detections (may limit performance)

**Analysis:** The consensus-based tuning appears to have been **too conservative** for PyTorch Pose. The extremely high confidence threshold (0.988) and low max_detections (10) resulted in many missed detections despite good accuracy when detections occurred.

**Best For:** Not recommended for production due to low detection rate. May be suitable if re-tuned with less conservative parameters.

#### MediaPipe

**Strengths:**

- Smallest model: 5.0 MB
- Very fast: 153.9 FPS
- High efficiency: 30.78 FPS/MB
- Perfect precision on COCO (no false positives)
- Low CPU usage: 9.8%

**Critical Weaknesses:**

- **Catastrophic detection failure:** Only 3.4% detection rate on surf footage
- Poor COCO recall: 19.6%
- Worst consensus: 38.4%
- Unsuitable for surf pose analysis

**Conclusion:** Despite technical merits, MediaPipe failed the core requirement of reliable person detection in surf scenarios.

#### BlazePose

**Strengths:**

- Fastest processing: 167.2 FPS
- Low latency: 7.40ms P95
- Perfect precision on COCO
- Excellent detection consistency: 98.8%
- Low CPU usage: 9.9%

**Critical Weaknesses:**

- **Severe detection failure:** Only 0.9% detection rate on surf footage
- Worst COCO recall: 13.8%
- Worst consensus: 31.2%
- Unsuitable for surf pose analysis

**Conclusion:** Speed advantages completely negated by inability to detect surfers reliably.

### 3.2 Impact of Consensus-Based Optimization

This evaluation's key innovation was using **consensus PCK as the optimization objective** for YOLOv8 and PyTorch models. Results show:

**YOLOv8-Pose: Major Success**

- Consensus PCK@0.2: 85.5% (up from ~79% with traditional tuning)
- Selected larger model (50.5 MB 'l' variant)
- Maintained excellent speed (99 FPS)
- **Recommendation:** Consensus-based optimization highly effective for YOLOv8

**PyTorch Pose: Over-Conservative**

- Detection rate collapsed: 41.1% (down from ~84% with traditional tuning)
- Consensus PCK@0.2: 51.4% (down from ~79% with traditional tuning)
- Parameters too restrictive (conf=0.988, max_det=10)
- **Recommendation:** Consensus-based optimization needs more permissive parameter ranges for PyTorch

**MMPose: No Direct Optimization**

- Used pre-determined parameters (no trials)
- Consensus PCK@0.2: 67.9% (down from ~93% in previous run)
- Regression may be due to dataset differences or ensemble effects
- **Recommendation:** Test consensus-based optimization for MMPose in future

### 3.3 Accuracy-Performance Trade-off Analysis

**Pareto Frontier:**

```
High Accuracy, Low Speed: YOLOv8-Pose (85.5% @ 99 FPS) ← OPTIMAL
                              ↓
Good Accuracy, Slower: MMPose (67.9% @ 33 FPS)
                              ↓
Moderate Accuracy, Moderate Speed: PyTorch (51.4% @ 40 FPS) - Not recommended
                              ↓
Low Accuracy, High Speed: MediaPipe/BlazePose (31-38% @ 154-167 FPS) - Unusable
```

**Optimal Selection:**

- **All Use Cases:** YOLOv8-Pose dominates the Pareto frontier (best accuracy + good speed)
- **Complete Skeletons Priority:** MMPose or re-tuned PyTorch Pose
- **Speed Critical (>100 FPS):** YOLOv8-Pose only viable option among accurate models

### 3.4 Failure Mode Analysis

**Why MediaPipe/BlazePose Failed:**

1. **Training Data Bias:** Likely optimized for upright standing poses, indoor scenes, and frontal views
2. **Scale Sensitivity:** Surfers appear at variable scales; models may expect closer, larger subjects
3. **Occlusion Handling:** Wave spray, water surface, and dynamic motion create novel occlusion patterns
4. **Motion Blur:** High-speed surfing motion may exceed training distribution
5. **Pose Variety:** Surfing poses (crouched, horizontal, twisted) differ from typical datasets
6. **Detection Thresholds:** Conservative thresholds optimized for precision sacrifice recall

**Why PyTorch Pose Underperformed:**

1. **Over-Conservative Tuning:** Confidence threshold of 0.988 too restrictive
2. **Low Max Detections:** Only 10 max detections may miss crowded scenes
3. **Consensus Optimization Issue:** TPE may have over-fit to Optuna dataset
4. **Two-Stage Architecture:** May be more sensitive to threshold choices than single-stage detectors

**Implications:**

- Domain-specific validation critical before deployment
- Benchmark performance (COCO) insufficient predictor of application performance
- Consensus-based optimization requires careful parameter range selection
- Single-stage detectors (YOLOv8) may be more robust to parameter variations

## 5. Conclusions and Recommendations

### 5.1 Primary Findings

1. **YOLOv8-Pose (Large, Consensus-Tuned) is the clear winner** with 85.5% consensus accuracy, 98.5% detection F1, 99 FPS, and 50.5 MB model size. Consensus-based optimization significantly improved performance.

2. **Consensus-based optimization highly effective for YOLOv8** but requires careful parameter range selection. PyTorch Pose's conservative tuning demonstrates the importance of permissive search spaces.

3. **MMPose showed unexpected regression** (67.9% vs 92.9% in previous run), warranting further investigation. Still excellent on COCO (89.8%) but underperformed on surf consensus.

4. **PyTorch Pose's consensus tuning was too conservative**, resulting in 41.1% detection rate. Requires re-tuning with less restrictive parameter ranges.

5. **MediaPipe and BlazePose remain unsuitable** for surf pose analysis, failing to detect 96-99% of poses despite speed advantages.

6. **YOLOv8 Large model (50.5 MB) provides best balance:** The larger variant selected by consensus optimization offers superior accuracy while maintaining excellent speed (99 FPS).

### 5.2 Decision Framework

**Select YOLOv8-Pose (Large) if:**

- Any production deployment (recommended for 95%+ of use cases)
- Need high consensus accuracy (85.5%)
- Real-time or near-real-time processing required
- Resource constraints (memory, compute, model size at 50.5 MB is acceptable)
- Detection reliability critical (98.5% F1)
- **Consensus-based optimization validated this as optimal choice**

**Select MMPose if:**

- COCO benchmark validation required (89.8% best)

   - May find optimal size-accuracy trade-off
   - Compare consensus accuracy across variants

4. **Ensemble Methods:**

   - Combine YOLOv8 (detection) + MMPose (refinement)
   - Weighted ensemble based on confidence
   - Two-stage pipeline: YOLOv8 primary, MMPose fallback

5. **Extended Consensus Optimization:**
