# Consensus-Based Optuna Optimization - Implementation Summary

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

Implementation completed for consensus-based pseudo-ground-truth system to fix broken Optuna optimization.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Session Analysis & Selection ✅

**File**: `utils/session_analyzer.py`

- Analyzes all SONY_300 and SONY_70 sessions
- Counts clips, maneuvers, classes, execution scores per session
- Recommends best SONY_300 session for consensus generation
- Splits remaining sessions for Optuna (50%) and comparison (50%)
- Ensures FULL/WIDE/standard variants stay together
- Prevents data leakage between splits

**Key Features**:

- Session-level grouping (extracts base name from variants)
- Quality scoring (maneuver count + diversity + execution scores)
- Reproducible splitting with random seed
- Detailed analysis reports

### 2. Adaptive Quality Filter ✅

**File**: `utils/quality_filter.py`

- Implements research-validated percentile-based filtering
- Composite scoring: `Q = 0.4*confidence + 0.4*stability + 0.2*completeness`
- Multi-stage adaptive percentiles:
  - Initialization (first 10% trials): 70th percentile (keep top 30%)
  - Growth (middle 60% trials): 80th percentile (keep top 20%)
  - Saturation (final 30% trials): 75th percentile (keep top 25%)
- Temporal stability calculation (exponential of negative variance)
- Skeleton completeness calculation (fraction detected above threshold)

**Key Features**:

- Automatic weight normalization
- Percentile-based (not fixed thresholds)
- Adapts throughout optimization process
- Batch processing support

### 3. Consensus Generator ✅

**File**: `utils/consensus_generator.py`

- Runs multiple models (YOLOv8, PyTorch Pose, MMPose) on consensus session
- Generates confidence-weighted mean of keypoint predictions
- Applies quality filtering with adaptive percentiles
- Saves consensus as structured JSON with per-frame data
- Supports leave-one-out consensus generation
- Includes data leakage verification
- Generates consensus for both Optuna and comparison validation sets

**Key Features**:

- ConsensusFrame, ConsensusManeuver, ConsensusDataset data classes
- Per-model predictions saved for transparency
- Quality scores per keypoint
- ConsensusLoader for loading pre-generated data
- Efficient caching to disk

### 4. Consensus-Based Pose Metrics ✅

**File**: `metrics/pose_metrics.py` (extended)

Added new methods:

- `calculate_metrics_with_consensus()`: Main evaluation method using consensus
- `_calculate_pck_frame()`: Single-frame PCK calculation

**Key Features**:

- Applies adaptive percentile filtering before PCK calculation
- Returns PCK@0.1, PCK@0.2, PCK@0.5
- Tracks consensus coverage and quality thresholds used
- Handles both 2D and 3D keypoints
- Matches keypoint dimensions automatically

### 5. Modified Optuna Optimizer ✅

**File**: `utils/optuna_optimizer.py` (modified)

Added consensus support:

- `_initialize_consensus_validation()`: Loads consensus data and quality filter
- `_evaluate_with_consensus()`: Evaluates model using consensus pseudo-GT
- `_get_consensus_for_model()`: Handles leave-one-out logic
- `_get_consensus_maneuver()`: Finds consensus for specific maneuver
- Modified `objective()` function to use consensus when available

**Key Features**:

- Automatic fallback to detection metrics if consensus unavailable
- Leave-one-out validation (excludes model from its own consensus)
- Integrates with adaptive percentile filtering
- Logs consensus usage and PCK scores
- Trial number passed for adaptive percentiles

### 6. Shared Consensus Configuration ✅

**File**: `configs/consensus_config.yaml` (new)

Centralized configuration for:

- Consensus generation settings
- Model selection (consensus vs excluded)
- Quality filter weights and percentile schedule
- Data split configuration
- Leave-one-out settings
- Quality reporting settings

### 7. Updated Evaluation Configs ✅

**Files**:

- `configs/evaluation_config_production_optuna.yaml`
- `configs/evaluation_config_production_comparison.yaml`

Changes:

- Added `consensus_config` reference
- Added `optuna_validation` / `comparison_validation` sections with `use_consensus: true`
- Reduced Optuna trials from 200 → 50 to prevent overfitting
- Specified camera selection for each validation phase

### 8. Consensus Generation Script ✅

**File**: `scripts/generate_consensus.py`

Standalone script that:

1. Analyzes sessions
2. Recommends consensus session
3. Updates config with session assignments
4. Generates consensus for Optuna validation
5. Generates consensus for comparison testing
6. Verifies no data leakage

**Usage**:

```bash
python scripts/generate_consensus.py --config configs/consensus_config.yaml
python scripts/generate_consensus.py --force  # Regenerate even if exists
python scripts/generate_consensus.py --analyze-only  # Just analyze
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Percentile Over Fixed Thresholds?

**Research shows** (PercentMatch, FreeMatch):

- Fixed thresholds (e.g., confidence > 0.7) fail when confidence distributions shift
- Percentile-based maintains consistent data utilization
- Adapts to model learning status automatically

### 2. Why Leave-One-Out?

**Prevents circular reasoning**:

- Model X evaluated against consensus from models Y & Z only
- Without LOO: Model would evaluate against its own predictions
- With LOO: True measure of how well model aligns with others

### 3. Why Multi-Stage Percentiles?

**Based on optimization phases**:

- **Early**: Conservative filtering (top 30%) for high-quality baseline
- **Middle**: Standard filtering (top 20%) as model learns
- **Late**: Slightly conservative (top 25%) to prevent overfitting

### 4. Why Reduce Trials to 50?

**Research shows**:

- 100+ trials can overfit to validation quirks
- 50 trials sufficient for parameter tuning
- Prevents exhaustive search that memorizes validation patterns

### 5. Why Session-Level Grouping?

**Prevents data leakage**:

- FULL/WIDE/standard are same surfer, same wave, same conditions
- If variants split across sets → model sees same content in train and test
- Session grouping ensures complete isolation

## Integration with Existing Code

### Minimal Changes to Existing Code

**Modified**:

- `utils/optuna_optimizer.py`: Added consensus support (backward compatible)
- `metrics/pose_metrics.py`: Added new methods (existing methods unchanged)
- Config files: Added new sections (existing sections unchanged)

**Not Modified**:

- `utils/pose_evaluator.py`: Still has old detection metrics for non-consensus use
- Model wrappers: No changes needed
- `run_evaluation.py`: Will detect consensus automatically

### Backward Compatibility

System gracefully falls back if consensus not available:

```python
if self.use_consensus and self.consensus_data:
    # Use consensus validation
    trial_metrics = self._evaluate_with_consensus(...)
else:
    # Fallback to detection metrics (old behavior)
    trial_metrics = [...]
```

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests Needed

1. **SessionAnalyzer**:

   - Test session name extraction from filenames
   - Test variant grouping (FULL/WIDE/standard)
   - Test quality scoring calculation
   - Test data leakage verification

2. **AdaptiveQualityFilter**:

   - Test composite score calculation
   - Test percentile threshold selection by trial phase
   - Test filtering with different percentiles
   - Test temporal stability calculation

3. **ConsensusGenerator**:
   - Test frame-by-frame consensus generation
   - Test leave-one-out consensus variants
   - Test data leakage verification
   - Test serialization/deserialization

### Integration Tests Needed

1. **End-to-End Consensus Generation**:

   - Generate consensus from real session
   - Verify output format
   - Check quality metrics

2. **Optuna with Consensus**:

   - Run small Optuna study (5 trials)
   - Verify PCK scores are non-zero
   - Verify convergence behavior

3. **Data Leakage Verification**:
   - Verify no session overlap between splits
   - Verify FULL/WIDE variants stay together

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Clip Loading Not Integrated**:

   - `load_clips_for_sessions()` is placeholder
   - Needs integration with DataSelectionManager
   - Currently uses maneuver objects passed from main pipeline

2. **Fixed Composite Weights**:

   - Weights (0.4/0.4/0.2) not tuned for surf footage
   - Could benefit from ablation studies

3. **No Per-Class Percentiles**:

   - All maneuver types use same threshold
   - Research shows per-class normalization helps with imbalanced data

4. **No Multi-View Support**:
   - Multi-camera data not synchronized/timecoded
   - Could use triangulation for higher quality GT

### Future Enhancements

1. **Ablation-Based Weighting**:

   - Dynamically weight models based on reliability
   - Detect and downweight outlier predictions

2. **Active Learning**:

   - Identify low-consensus regions
   - Request manual annotations for uncertain cases

3. **Consensus Quality Dashboard**:

   - Real-time monitoring during generation
   - Visualize agreement heatmaps
   - Track quality metrics over time

4. **Hierarchical Percentiles**:
   - Per-maneuver-class thresholds
   - Adaptive to clip difficulty
