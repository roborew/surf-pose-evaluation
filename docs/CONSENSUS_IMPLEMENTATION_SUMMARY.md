# Consensus-Based Optuna Optimization - Implementation Summary

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

Implementation completed for consensus-based pseudo-ground-truth system to fix broken Optuna optimization.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Data Selection ✅

**File**: `utils/data_selection_manager.py` (existing)

- Selects validation clips (75 for Optuna, 200 for comparison)
- Ensures no overlap between Optuna and comparison sets
- Uses existing session-level grouping to prevent data leakage
- Maintains consistent clip selection across runs

**Key Features**:

- Integration with existing data selection system
- No separate "consensus session" - uses validation clips directly
- Reproducible selection with random seed
- Clean separation between validation sets

### 2. Adaptive Quality Filter ✅

**File**: `utils/quality_filter.py`

- Implements research-validated percentile-based filtering
- Composite scoring: `Q = 0.4*confidence + 0.4*stability + 0.2*completeness`
- Multi-stage adaptive percentiles:
  - Initialization (first 10% trials): 70th percentile (keep top 30%)
  - Growth (middle 60% trials): 80th percentile (keep top 20%)
  - Saturation (final 30% trials): 75th percentile (keep top 25%)
- Temporal stability calculation (exponential of negative variance)
- Skeleton completeness calculation (fraction detected above threshold)

**Key Features**:

- Automatic weight normalization
- Percentile-based (not fixed thresholds)
- Adapts throughout optimization process
- Batch processing support

### 3. Consensus Generator ✅

**File**: `utils/consensus_generator.py`

- Runs multiple models (YOLOv8, PyTorch Pose, MMPose) on validation clips
- Generates confidence-weighted mean of keypoint predictions
- Applies quality filtering with adaptive percentiles
- Saves consensus as structured JSON with per-frame data
- Supports leave-one-out consensus generation
- Generates separate consensus for Optuna and comparison validation sets

**Key Features**:

- ConsensusFrame, ConsensusManeuver, ConsensusDataset data classes
- Per-model predictions saved for transparency
- Quality scores per keypoint
- ConsensusLoader for loading pre-generated data
- Efficient caching to disk

### 4. Consensus-Based Pose Metrics ✅

**File**: `metrics/pose_metrics.py` (extended)

Added new methods:

- `calculate_metrics_with_consensus()`: Main evaluation method using consensus
- `_calculate_pck_frame()`: Single-frame PCK calculation

**Key Features**:

- Applies adaptive percentile filtering before PCK calculation
- Returns PCK@0.1, PCK@0.2, PCK@0.5
- Tracks consensus coverage and quality thresholds used
- Handles both 2D and 3D keypoints
- Matches keypoint dimensions automatically

### 5. Modified Optuna Optimizer ✅

**File**: `utils/optuna_optimizer.py` (modified)

Added consensus support:

- `_initialize_consensus_validation()`: Loads consensus data and quality filter
- `_evaluate_with_consensus()`: Evaluates model using consensus pseudo-GT
- `_get_consensus_for_model()`: Handles leave-one-out logic
- `_get_consensus_maneuver()`: Finds consensus for specific maneuver
- Modified `objective()` function to use consensus when available

**Key Features**:

- Automatic fallback to detection metrics if consensus unavailable
- Leave-one-out validation (excludes model from its own consensus)
- Integrates with adaptive percentile filtering
- Logs consensus usage and PCK scores
- Trial number passed for adaptive percentiles

### 6. Shared Consensus Configuration ✅

**File**: `configs/consensus_config.yaml` (new)

Centralized configuration for:

- Consensus generation settings
- Model selection (consensus vs excluded)
- Quality filter weights and percentile schedule
- Data split configuration
- Leave-one-out settings
- Quality reporting settings

### 7. Updated Evaluation Configs ✅

**Files**:

- `configs/evaluation_config_production_optuna.yaml`
- `configs/evaluation_config_production_comparison.yaml`

Changes:

- Added `consensus_config` reference
- Added `optuna_validation` / `comparison_validation` sections with `use_consensus: true`
- Reduced Optuna trials from 200 → 50 to prevent overfitting
- Specified camera selection for each validation phase

### 8. Pipeline Integration ✅

**File**: `run_evaluation.py` (modified)

Integrated consensus generation into main pipeline:

1. Automatically detects if consensus is needed
2. Selects validation clips via DataSelectionManager
3. Generates consensus GT upfront
4. Runs Optuna with consensus data
5. Runs comparison with separate consensus data
6. All artifacts saved to run directory

**Usage**:

```bash
python run_evaluation.py --run-name "my_experiment"  # Automatic
```

**Note**: `scripts/generate_consensus.py` is deprecated

### 9. Documentation ✅

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Percentile Over Fixed Thresholds?

**Research shows** (PercentMatch, FreeMatch):

- Fixed thresholds (e.g., confidence > 0.7) fail when confidence distributions shift
- Percentile-based maintains consistent data utilization
- Adapts to model learning status automatically

### 2. Why Leave-One-Out?

**Prevents circular reasoning**:

- Model X evaluated against consensus from models Y & Z only
- Without LOO: Model would evaluate against its own predictions
- With LOO: True measure of how well model aligns with others

### 3. Why Multi-Stage Percentiles?

**Based on optimization phases**:

- **Early**: Conservative filtering (top 30%) for high-quality baseline
- **Middle**: Standard filtering (top 20%) as model learns
- **Late**: Slightly conservative (top 25%) to prevent overfitting

### 4. Why Reduce Trials to 50?

**Research shows**:

- 100+ trials can overfit to validation quirks
- 50 trials sufficient for parameter tuning
- Prevents exhaustive search that memorizes validation patterns

### 5. Why Separate Validation Sets?

**Prevents data leakage**:

- Optuna clips (75) used for parameter tuning
- Comparison clips (200) used for final testing
- No overlap between sets ensures unbiased final evaluation
- DataSelectionManager handles session-level grouping automatically

## Integration with Existing Code

### Minimal Changes to Existing Code

**Modified**:

- `utils/optuna_optimizer.py`: Added consensus support (backward compatible)
- `metrics/pose_metrics.py`: Added new methods (existing methods unchanged)
- Config files: Added new sections (existing sections unchanged)

**Not Modified**:

- `utils/pose_evaluator.py`: Still has old detection metrics for non-consensus use
- Model wrappers: No changes needed
- `run_evaluation.py`: Will detect consensus automatically

### Backward Compatibility

System gracefully falls back if consensus not available:

```python
if self.use_consensus and self.consensus_data:
    # Use consensus validation
    trial_metrics = self._evaluate_with_consensus(...)
else:
    # Fallback to detection metrics (old behavior)
    trial_metrics = [...]
```

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests Needed

1. **SessionAnalyzer**:

   - Test session name extraction from filenames
   - Test variant grouping (FULL/WIDE/standard)
   - Test quality scoring calculation
   - Test data leakage verification

2. **AdaptiveQualityFilter**:

   - Test composite score calculation
   - Test percentile threshold selection by trial phase
   - Test filtering with different percentiles
   - Test temporal stability calculation

3. **ConsensusGenerator**:
   - Test frame-by-frame consensus generation
   - Test leave-one-out consensus variants
   - Test data leakage verification
   - Test serialization/deserialization

### Integration Tests Needed

1. **End-to-End Consensus Generation**:

   - Generate consensus from real session
   - Verify output format
   - Check quality metrics

2. **Optuna with Consensus**:

   - Run small Optuna study (5 trials)
   - Verify PCK scores are non-zero
   - Verify convergence behavior

3. **Data Leakage Verification**:
   - Verify no session overlap between splits
   - Verify FULL/WIDE variants stay together

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Fixed Composite Weights**:

   - Weights (0.4/0.4/0.2) not tuned for surf footage
   - Could benefit from ablation studies

2. **No Per-Class Percentiles**:

   - All maneuver types use same threshold
   - Research shows per-class normalization helps with imbalanced data

3. **No Multi-View Support**:
   - Multi-camera data not synchronized/timecoded
   - Could use triangulation for higher quality GT

### Future Enhancements

1. **Ablation-Based Weighting**:

   - Dynamically weight models based on reliability
   - Detect and downweight outlier predictions

2. **Active Learning**:

   - Identify low-consensus regions
   - Request manual annotations for uncertain cases

3. **Consensus Quality Dashboard**:

   - Real-time monitoring during generation
   - Visualize agreement heatmaps
   - Track quality metrics over time

4. **Hierarchical Percentiles**:
   - Per-maneuver-class thresholds
   - Adaptive to clip difficulty
