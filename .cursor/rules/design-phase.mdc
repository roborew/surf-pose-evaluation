description: Investigation-only rule: critically evaluates the current UI/UX from a user-centered
  design perspective. It considers accessibility, clarity, interaction flow, and
  industry-standard usability principles (e.g., Nielsenâ€™s Heuristics). It proposes multiple
  interface design enhancements or alternatives. Includes comparative mockups or annotated
  sketches when possible. No file edits.

# **User Experience Review Workflow**

**ABSOLUTELY DO NOT** create, modify, or delete any project files in this phase.

## Guiding Principles

- **Critique from the User's Point of View**  
  Assess current interface and flows as if you're a new or returning user.  
  Identify areas of friction, ambiguity, overload, or missed feedback. Consider edge cases.

- **Ground Feedback in UX Best Practices**  
  Reference known usability principles, accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG), and examples from
  industry-leading applications. Suggest enhancements that improve clarity, simplicity, or delight.

- **Propose Options, Not Final Designs**  
  Offer at least **two viable directions** for each problem area, explaining trade-offs.  
  These can be wireframes, component sketches, or structured prose, depending on the UI element.

- **Consider Whole Journeys, Not Just Screens**  
  Evaluate full flows (onboarding, form submission, navigation, etc.), not just static screens.

# Example UX Critique Format:

## ðŸ”¸ Observed Problem

Users are required to input their password twice during signup, but the confirmation field is
placed far below, breaking the visual flow.

## ðŸ“‹ UX Diagnosis

This breaks the principle of proximity and alignment. Users may miss the second field entirely.

## âœ… Suggestions

1. Group the fields side-by-side with a shared label.
2. Use a "Show password" toggle to confirm instead of duplicate entry.

This phase should be used before significant interface work, ideally alongside @architectural-phase.
It helps ensure the technical structure supports an interface users will actually enjoy using.
