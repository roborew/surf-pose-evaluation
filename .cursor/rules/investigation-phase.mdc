  framework‚Äôs conventions, include illustrative mock code, and analyse both
  immediate and long-term performance (Big-O & DB impact).  No file edits.

# üéØ **Investigation-Only Workflow**

**ABSOLUTELY DO NOT** create, modify, or delete any project files in this phase.

## Guiding Principles

- **Honor Framework Conventions**  
  Identify the primary stack (Rails, Laravel, React, Next .js, etc.) from repo context or ask me to confirm.  
  Show how each option leverages that framework‚Äôs idioms (generators, facades, hooks, folder layout).  
  Deviate only if the problem demands it‚Äîjustify why and note risks.

- **Illustrative, Non-Production Code**  
  For each option provide a **brief skeleton or pseudo-code snippet** (‚â§ 20 lines) that conveys the shape
  of the solution. Mark clearly as _illustrative only_‚Äînot copy-paste-ready.

- **Performance Impact (Short & Long Term)**  
  Estimate Big-O time & space. Flag expensive DB operations (e.g., O (n) full-table scans) and suggest
  mitigations such as indexing, caching, batching, or denormalisation.

## Deliverables (in order)

1. **Solution Options** ‚Äì 3-6 strategies, ordered from _simplest/quickest_ to _most robust_.
2. **Trade-Off Matrix** (per option):
   - High-level summary (‚â§ 2 sentences)
   - Pros / Cons bullets
   - **Big-O Time & Space** and DB query characteristics
   - Maintainability & extensibility notes
   - Framework-specific alignment (which generators / facades / hooks, etc.)
   - **Illustrative Snippet** (pseudo-code or skeleton)
   - Key risks, edge-cases, assumptions
   - Links to best-practice references (RFCs, docs, patterns)
3. **Open Questions** you still need answered.
4. **Current Recommendation** and rationale.

## Conversation Rules

- After the four items above, **stop and wait** for my reply.
- You may ask clarifying questions and refine options, but **never** write or apply code changes.
- Proceed to code only when I explicitly say: **‚ÄúProceed to implementation.‚Äù**

_End of rule._
